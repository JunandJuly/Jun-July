  <br><h2>Our business</h2>
    <h3><p>How are we going to change the world?</p></h3>
      <p>This is the question we have to keep in our mind all the time.
      <br>We have been creating a lot of ideas for our business. <br>But there are some falws of not feasible to the reality.
      <br>For example, absence of cost back-up, <br>or insufficient logic for creating profit which is not strong business model.</p>
    <H3><br><p>What do we have to do then?</h3>
      <p>I mena what do we have to consider first?
      <br>Do we have to search a bunch of information first? <br>or do we just start to study this kind of web and app coding?
      <br>We have finally decided to find out topic or issue, or item,
      <br>if you want, what we ase good at, what we are not tired of even when we keep doing everyday.</p>
